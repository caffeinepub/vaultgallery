        "On narrow viewports (e.g., 360–430px wide), the header content fits within the viewport without horizontal scrolling or clipped buttons.",
        "Navigation remains fully usable on mobile (e.g., via a collapsed menu, icon-only buttons, or a horizontally scrollable nav that remains discoverable).",
        "The Login/Logout control remains accessible on mobile without overlapping other controls.",
        "No regression on desktop/tablet layouts; the current header layout remains usable and visually consistent at >= 768px width."

        "When switching between views on mobile, the main content area is visible and scrollable as expected (e.g., Library grid and page headers are not hidden behind the app header).",
        "No unintended blank/empty panel occupies the majority of the screen after navigation on mobile.",
        "Pages that already manage their own scrolling (e.g., `h-full overflow-auto`) continue to scroll properly within the app shell."
